# Notes

## General
- Check for understanding
- PowerPoint get the methods in for Strings and Snowflake
- Poss put in some tips about the 'order' in which to carry out methods
- On Visual 1 - do we need to demonstrate exactly what happens, line-by-line as we apply methods and how we know to apply the next one

## Data Types
- Add dates in here

## Comments
- Make sure to show how to use these

## Visuals
- Just highlight that we use """ when injecting SQL to Python
- Look at `figsize` on Matplotlib - is there a 'best fit' setting?
- Demonstrate `Save as` when we've completed a visual
- Can we do `GBPUSD` rather than `USDGBP`?
- Visual 2 - do 1/1/24 - 31/12/24 - average rate monthly using the ID day rate (there are different 'types' of rate measurements that come through to the table - hence multiple entries)
